I am Oluwadarasimi Falade. I am currently graduate student at both Lucerne University of Sciences and Arts (Masters in ITDS) and Northeastern Illinois University (Masters in Computer Science).
In this GitHub profile, multiple projects can be found. From Blockchain projects, to AI projects. These projects were not done alone but with amazing team members. For some of the projects I had the role of project owner and lead developer.
